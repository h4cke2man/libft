# Libft

## About the Project
This is my library that I created and that I'll use for all my next c projects. <br/>
Compile all the library with `make` <br/>
After that you can use my library in your c project by including the header: `#include "<path_of_lib>libft.h"` <br/>
And compile with my library: `gcc <all_your_file> lft -L<path_of_lib>`

## Curious ?
You can see the subject [here](libft.fr.pdf)
